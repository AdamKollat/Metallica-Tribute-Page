    <h1>The greatest heavy metal band of all time</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Metallica was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/gutarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich. 
        Insired by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal they recorded their first original song "Hit the lights" in early 1982.
        Their first live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour.
        In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in the band Trauma. 
        They were blown away by Burton and asked him to join the band as they were not happy with McGovney's contribution to the band. 
        Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year, he had accepted on the condition the band move to the San Francisco Bay Area.
        In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Kill 'Em All. 
        The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.
        Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon. 
        Metallica has recorded three albums and toured successfully until the tragic death of Cliff Burton as a result of a road accident on September 27, 1986. 
        Bassist Jason Newstead joined the band and the line up remained the same until Newstead eventually left on January 17, 2001. 
        The band recruited Robert Trujillo to replace Newstead and the band's line up hasn't changed since.</p>
